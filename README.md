![Baseline_Regression_Arch_with_exp](https://github.com/zhu-xlab/So2Sat-POP-DL/assets/61827990/967f18f8-64dc-4a9d-b1ed-16a03095e0c4)


## Data set


So2Sat POP dataset covering 98 EU cities. 
The data set has two parts. Each part can be downloaded using the following links:
So2Sat POP Part1 DOI: https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/1633792
So2Sat POP Part2 DOI: https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/1633795
Data set provides the predefined train/test split.
Randomly selected: 80% as train (80 cities) / 20% as test (18 cities)
```

Please note that to install rasterio and GDAL, download the binary wheels for your system [rasterio](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#rasterio) and [GDAL](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#gdal). Run from the downloads folder.
```
pip install GDAL-3.4.3-cp38-cp38-win_amd64.whl
pip install rasterio-1.2.10-cp38-cp38-win_amd64.whl
```


Download the data set and add it to the current folder to run the following scripts (for both classification and regression):
```
skipt_train.py: To start the training
eval.py: to evaluat the trained model eithet on the whole data set or on individual cities.
evaluate_ghs_ours_eu.py: compute the evaluation metrics on eu cities with ghs-pop and our's predictions.
evaluate_ghs_ours_us.py: compute the metrics on ghs-pop and ours prediction on us cities.
```
